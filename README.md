## 📝 Notes

- Ensure that the sender's email (default: `roronoagreatestswordsman@gmail.com`) allows **less secure apps** or **app password** if using 2FA.
- The email credentials are hardcoded — it is recommended to use environment variables or a `.env` file for production use.
- Make sure the directory path is **absolute** (not relative).

---

## 📧 Email Configuration

The email is sent using:
- SMTP Server: `smtp.gmail.com`
- Port: `465` (SSL)
- From: `roronoagreatestswordsman@gmail.com`

**Update the script with your own email & app password for secure use.**

---

## 🏁 Output

- Duplicate files will be deleted.
- Log file will be created in the `Marvellous/` directory.
- Email will be sent with the log file attached.
